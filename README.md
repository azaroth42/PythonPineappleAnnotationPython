# Python Pineapple Annotation Python

## Description

Python Pineapple Annotation Python (PPAP) is a small consuming implementation in Python of the Web Annotation protocol and model (the Annotation Python part).  It then produces static HTML from the pages, to be incorporated into site generators such as Hyde (python) or Jekyll (ruby) ... the Python Pineapple part.

## Usage

Simply point annotationPython at a conforming implementation, and it will produce the pages.

`python ./annotationPython.py &lt;url&gt;`

## Naming

Seriously, what's up with the stupid name?

It's from a children's youtube video (Pen Pineapple Apple Pen) that went viral in which a man in a yellow jumpsuit mimes smushing together a pen and a pineapple and then a pen and an apple.  He then smushes together both of these, proudly proclaiming "Pen Pineapple Apple Pen".  Here we have some Python, we have some Annotations ... Annotation-Python! The implementation of Python-Pineapple is currently left as an exercise for the reader.  Showing PPAP has been proven to have a calming effect on demanding three year olds.

It's also a hint that this is probably not meant to be used in a serious production environment. At least at the moment.
